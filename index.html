      <span class="verse">1</span>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
      <span class="verse">2</span>He was with God in the beginning.
      <span class="verse">3</span>Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.
      <span class="verse">4</span>In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.
      <span class="verse">5</span>The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
      <span class="verse">6</span>There was a man sent from God whose name was John.
      <span class="verse">7</span>He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe.
      <span class="verse">8</span>He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.
      <span class="verse">9</span>The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.
      <span class="verse">10</span>He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.
      <span class="verse">11</span>He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.
      <span class="verse">12</span>Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God—
      <span class="verse">13</span>children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.
